    <h1>What has<span>SP done??</span></h1> 
    <p>
        To create a more sustainable future for everyone, SP integrate their practices, courses, relationships, and people.   
    </p>

    <div class="row1">
        <div class="v-col">
            <h3>Cherish natural resources</h3>
            <p>SP feel that protecting natural resources for the future is their responsibility. SP have stopped utilizing bottled water at events to cut down on plastic waste on campus, starting with conscientious consumption. SP will put up solar panels all across campus in 2023 to use clean, renewable energy.</p>
            
        </div>
        
        <div class="v-col">
            <h3>Spreading joy through green spaces</h3>
            <p>SP think that in order to improve their community's general mental health and well-being, it is important to create surroundings that assist people physically, emotionally, and culturally. In an effort to create more livable places, SP has installed sophisticated sensors that monitor interior air quality and human traffic in order to maintain a comfortable environment and contented residents.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="v-col">
            <h3>Rally the community to amplify impact</h3>
            <p>The first step on their path to a more sustainable future is within. The SP Environment Club is a student organization that uses a range of initiatives, contests, and social media posts to promote environmental awareness on campus.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row2">
        <div class="v-col">
            <h3>Study, work and play among lush greenery</h3>
            <p>SP has worked to integrate their structures with their natural surroundings rather than replace them since the first stone of our lovely campus was laid. Additionally, we have recorded 230 different types of plant life on campus, including the magnificent Brown Woolly Fig Heritage Trees located next to Food Court 1.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="v-col">
            <h3>Harness green partnerships for our future</h3>
            <p>To advance the green agenda, we think it's critical to collaborate. Our collaborations with leading companies in the sector, such Grundfos, Danfoss, and Singapore Green Building Council, go beyond creating environmentally friendly products for regional businesses. The Singaporean workforce is constantly being upskilled in sustainable business methods.

                One such project entails collaborating with Samwoh, a top integrated construction company, to build a more lasting surface using recycled plastic for our roads and pavements.</p>

        <div class="v-col">
            <h3>Nurture stewards of the environment</h3>
            <p>Their goal as a polytechnic for all ages is to prepare our students to be world-ready, work-ready, and life-ready for Singapore's transition. By include sustainability modules in our curriculum, SP seek to plant the seeds for future environmental stewards.

                Through our Common Core Curriculum, SP students are introduced to the SG Green Plan and the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN. SP also includes modules on sustainability in our full-time diploma programs and Continuing Education and Training courses.</p>

                <p>SP is currently testing the first solar photovoltaic recycling line. This innovative technique involves using a machine to disassemble solar panels and extract recyclable components like glass and silver. The recycling line aims to process 80 panels per day and achieve a maximum recovery rate of 95%. Dr. Thong Ta Xuan, a Senior Research Scientist at TIE, was interviewed regarding this development. In addition, SP has established two laboratories, namely the SP-Sembcorp Solar PV Research Lab and the SP-CHINT Smart Electrical Power Training Laboratory, to further research and development in the solar energy sector. The news was also reported by 8World.</p>
